## üõ†Ô∏è **How Does It Work?**

The app is built using **Streamlit**, a powerful framework for creating data-driven web apps, and leverages **Google‚Äôs Gemini API** for AI-powered recipe generation. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its features:

### **User Inputs**
The app‚Äôs sidebar collects all your preferences:
- **Mood**: Choose from options like happy, tired, adventurous, or stressed.
- **Cuisine**: Select your preferred cuisine or opt for no preference.
- **Time Available**: Use a slider to specify how much time you have (5 to 120 minutes).
- **Skill Level**: Indicate whether you're a beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert cook.
- **Appliances**: Select the kitchen tools you have, like an oven, air fryer, or blender.
- **Dietary Restrictions & Allergies**: Specify any dietary needs or allergies.
- **Health Goals**: Choose goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or heart health.

### **Recipe Generation**
Once you‚Äôve entered your preferences, the app uses the Gemini API to generate three tailored recipes. Here‚Äôs how the recipe generation works:
```python
prompt = f""" 
        Suggest 3 recipes based on the following:
        - Mood: {mood}
        - Cuisine Preference: {cuisine}
        - Time Available: {time} minutes
        - Skill Level: {skill}
        - Available Ingredients: {ingredients}
        - Available Appliances: {', '.join(appliances) if appliances else 'None'}
        - Dietary Restrictions: {', '.join(dietary_restrictions) if dietary_restrictions else 'None'}
        - Allergies: {', '.join(allergies) if allergies else 'None'}
        - Health Goals: {', '.join(health_goals) if health_goals else 'None'}

        Ensure the recipes:
        - Match the mood and preferences.
        - Use the listed ingredients as much as possible.
        - Explicitly list missing ingredients.
        - Provide cooking instructions.
        - Provide Nutritional Information (Calories, Protein, Carbs, etc.).

        Return the result as a JSON array with the following structure:
        [
          {{
              "name": "Recipe Name",
              "prep_time": "Time in minutes",
              "missing_ingredients": ["list of missing ingredients"],
              "instructions": "Detailed cooking instructions",
              "nutritional_info": {{
                  "calories": "x",
                  "protein": "x",
                  "carbs": "x",
                  "fat": "x"
              }},
              "shopping_list": ["list of missing ingredients"]
          }} 
        ]

        Important Notes:
        1. Escape all newline characters in the instructions field with \\n to ensure valid JSON formatting.
        2. Do not include any additional text or comments outside the JSON array.
        3. Only return valid JSON in the response.
    """
    
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    print("LLM response:", response.text)

    if response:
        try:
            # Parse the response as JSON
            preprocess_response = response.text.replace("```json", "").replace('```', "")
            recipes = json.loads(preprocess_response)
            print("Recipes:", recipes)
            
            # Store recipes in session state to persist across reruns
            st.session_state.recipes = recipes

        except Exception as e:
            st.error("Error parsing the response. Please try again.")
            print(e)
            st.write(f"Error Details: {e}")
```
Once you‚Äôve entered your preferences, the app uses the Gemini API to generate three tailored recipes. Each recipe includes:
- **Name**: The title of the dish.
- **Prep Time**: How long it takes to cook.
- **Missing Ingredients**: A list of ingredients you‚Äôll need to buy.
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step cooking instructions.
- **Nutritional Information**: Calories, protein, carbs, and fat content.
- **Shopping List**: A handy list of missing ingredients to take to the store.

### **Image-Based Ingredient Detection**
The latest feature allows you to upload an image of your ingredients. Here‚Äôs how it works:
1. **Upload an Image**: Snap a picture of the ingredients in your fridge or pantry and upload it to the app.
2. **AI-Powered Detection**: The app uses advanced image recognition technology to identify the ingredients in your photo.
3. **Recipe Suggestions**: Based on the detected ingredients, the app generates personalized recipes that match your mood, dietary preferences, and health goals.
```python
# Image Upload for Ingredient Detection
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload an image of your ingredients", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    # Display the uploaded image
    st.image(uploaded_file, caption='Uploaded Image', use_column_width=True)
    
    # Use a pre-trained model to detect ingredients
    detected_ingredients = detect_ingredients(uploaded_file)
    
    # Display detected ingredients
    st.write("Detected Ingredients:", detected_ingredients)
    
    # Use detected ingredients for recipe generation
    ingredients = ", ".join(detected_ingredients)
```
### **Recent Meals**
To avoid repetition, the app lets you log recent meals. You can add or edit these meals, ensuring you always have fresh ideas.

### **Gamification**
The app tracks the recipes you‚Äôve cooked, creating a personal collection of your culinary achievements. It‚Äôs a fun way to stay motivated and explore new dishes.
